# Tree Terminology

- **Node**: The basic unit of a tree, which contains data and possibly links to other nodes.
- **Root**: The topmost node of the tree, which serves as the starting point of the tree structure.
- **Child Node**: A node that is directly linked to another node in the hierarchy. Each node can have multiple child nodes.
- **Parent Node**: A node that has one or more child nodes.
- **Leaf Node**: A node that does not have any child nodes.
- **Sibling Nodes**: Nodes that share the same parent node.
- **Edge**: The link between two nodes in the tree.
- **Path**: A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node to another node.
- **Depth of a Node**: The number of edges from the root to the node.
- **Height of a Node**: The number of edges on the longest downward path between that node and a leaf.
- **Level of a Node**: The level of a node is defined by 1 + the number of connections between the node and the root.
- **Subtree**: A portion of the tree consisting of a node and all its descendants.
- **Ancestor of a Node**: Any predecessor node on a path from the root to that node.
- **Descendant of a Node**: Any successor node on a path from the root to that node.
